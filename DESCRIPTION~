Title: Dispersion Statistics for Small Samples
Author: Paul Kattuman, Thilo Klein, Jun Ma
Maintainer: Paul Kattuman <pak13@cam.ac.uk>
Description: This program generates dispersion measures P(S more equal than s)
    and P(S less equal than s) for data vectors of size n. The approach is to
    resample from the data vector, choosing 3 elements randomly, and find the
    defined measures with S drawn from the uniform distribution on the unit
    2-simplex, with bss resamples
